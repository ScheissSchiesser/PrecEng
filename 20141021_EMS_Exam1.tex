\begin{homeworkProblem}


\begin{homeworkSection}{(a)}

A 3 V-groove kinematic mount where the lines forming each V meet in the center allows thermal expansion from the center, since each V allows one axis of translational motion. In a Cup-V-Flat mount, the cup allows no translational motion, so the expansion occurs about that point, causing the expansion to be asymmetric about the center. This could be a problem when mounting optics because it will cause boresight error. Also, depending on the orientation of the V in the Cup-V-Flat, the thermal expansion could cause a rotation about the Cup, since the sphere in the V must follow the single translation axis it allows. Thus, use the 3-Vee groove when concerned with thermal expansion. The Vees need to be precisely machined so that they will allow expansion from the center, so the Cup-V-Flat is the better/cheaper option when you don’t need to worry about thermal expansion about the center of the mount (for instance, you are mounting a plane mirror that is underfilled).


\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(b)}

As we can see from the above plots, the highest pressure is at a steep angle, due to the direct relationship between the normal force $F_n$ and the contact pressure. Since $F_n$ increases with V-groove angle ($F_n=F \sin⁡(\theta)$), the contact pressure increases.

\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(c)}

I assume that the vertical displacement of the sphere is the projection of the $\delta$ described in the notes: 

\begin{equation}
\delta = a^2/(2R^\star)
\end{equation}

\begin{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(a)}
BK-7 has a CTE of $\alpha_{BK7} =  \SI{7.1e-6}{\per\kelvin}$ and aluminum has a CTE of $\alpha_{Al} = \SI{23.6e-6}{\per\kelvin}$. The adhesive has $\alpha_{RTV} =  \SI{200e-6}{\per\kelvin}$. A $\SI{100}{\milli\meter}$ lens will expand by $\SI{85.2}{\micro\meter}$ in a temperature range from $\SI{-40}{\celsius}$ to $\SI{-80}{\celsius}$ (under linear approximation). The glue will not stress the optic if we allow enough space between the lens diameter $d_g$ and the mount diameter $d_m$ according to:
\begin{equation}
h_r = \frac{d_g (\alpha_{Al} - \alpha_{BK7})}{2 (\alpha_{RTV} - \alpha_{Al})} = \SI{4.677}{\milli\meter}
\end{equation}
where $h_r$ is the difference between the lens semi-diameter and the mount semi-diameter.
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(b)}
In there is some cocentricity error between the optical axis and the physical axis, we can drill threaded holes and use nylon screws to push around the lens until the optical axis is centered correctly, and then inject the adhesive through injection holes to hold it in place. The screws could then be removed if necessary.

We could also use tangential or spherical seats on the mount to allow the optic to self-center, although these seats would have to be precisely machined and there would need to be enough room between the edges of the lens and the mount to allow for the lens to move to its optically centered position.

This cocentricity error would add time and cost to the assembly process because it requires a custom alignment of each optical element, which is time consuming and expensive because a human has to do it.
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(c)}

\begin{equation}
\delta_{RMS}=0.316 \frac{\rho g}{E} \frac{r^4}{t^2} (1-\nu^2)
\end{equation}

Solving this for the thickness $t$, we get:

\begin{equation}
t=0.5621 \sqrt{\frac{\rho g}{E} \frac{r^4}{\delta_{RMS}} (1-\nu^2)}
\end{equation}

We have $E= \SI{90.3}{\giga\pascal}$, $\rho = \SI{2.53}{\gram\per\cubic\centi\meter}$, and $\nu = 0.24$ for Zerodur. These values give:
$$
t = \SI{36.2}{\milli\meter}
$$
which gives an estimated mass of:
$$
m = \pi r^2 t \rho = \SI{6.48}{\kilo\gram}
$$

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{homeworkSection}{(a)}
The efficiency is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:efficiency}
e=\frac{\cos{(\alpha)} ( \pi \beta \cos{(\alpha)} - \mu}{\pi \beta \cos{(\alpha)} (\cos{(\alpha)} + \pi \beta \mu)}
\end{equation}
where $\beta=d/l=4$, $\alpha = \ang{15}$, $l=\SI{5}{\milli\meter}$, $\mu = 0.05$ and $d=\SI{20}{\milli\meter}$.
These values give an efficiency of $e=0.603$, or about $60\%$.
The resulting output force is given by:
\begin{equation}
F_z = \frac{2\pi e \mu_z}{l}
\end{equation}
Solving for torque, $\mu_z$:
\begin{equation}
\mu_z= \frac{l F_z}{2\pi e}
\end{equation}
To apply a force of $F_z = \SI{500}{\newton}$, we require a torque of $\SI{0.659}{\newton\meter}$.

\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(b)}
The diameter required is given by solving equation ~\ref{eq:efficiency} for $\beta$ and subsequently $d$.
\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{1}{2 \pi e \mu} \left[ (1-e) \cos{\alpha} \pm \sqrt{(1-e)^2 \cos^2{\alpha}-4 e \mu^2} \right]
\end{equation}
The resulting equation is the solution to a quadratic equation in $\beta$, and therefore we have two possible values which give an efficiency of $90\%$, $d = \SI{1.39}{ \milli\meter}$ and $d = \SI{2.03}{ \milli\meter}$.
\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{(c)}
Assuming no lubrication (not likely) and mild steel, the coefficient of friction is $\mu_{SS} = 0.57$, which gives an efficiency of $e_{SS} = 0.113$. Best case scenario, with a greasy surface and hard steel, $\mu_{SS, grs} = 0.029$, giving $e_{SS, grs} = 0.724$.

With steel on oil-impregnated brass, the coefficient of friction is  $\mu_{SS} = $
